/*
 * According to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP),
 * no class should be forced to implement methods it does not use.
 *
 * If we define a single interface containing both rider and driver behaviors
 * (like bookRide, acceptRide, drive, endRide, payRide, etc.),
 * then classes like Rider will be forced to implement driver-related methods,
 * which they don't need â€” violating ISP.
 *
 * To solve this, we separate the responsibilities into smaller,
 * more specific interfaces such as RiderInterface and DriverInterface.
 *
 * This ensures that each class implements only the methods that are
 * relevant to its role, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
